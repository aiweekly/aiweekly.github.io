There are plenty of influential academic papers published every day on artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML). So staying up-to-date with the latest trends has become increasingly difficult for AI researchers. 

I aim to provide my notes on the research papers that I find interesting every week. The papers that I write about are mostly related to natural language processing and computer vision research.

This project was inspired by Jack Clark's awesome blog [Import AI](https://jack-clark.net/). Be sure to check it out if you want to follow the latest AI news and research.
